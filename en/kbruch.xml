	<description lang="en">kbruch is a small Program to practise fractional arithmetic. Their are 4 different lessons:
	[ul]
		[li]Lesson 1: Exercises: Looking for numerator and denominator of a result. The dificulty level can be defined by the student, as if he wants to practise Addition/Subtraction or Multiplikation/Division of the fractions. Furthermore the number of fractions (as operators) and the maximum size of the main denominator can be chosen.[/li]
		[li]Lesson2: comparing fractions -in this exercise you have to compare the size of fractions.[/li]
		[li]Lesson3: converting into a fraction - in this exercise you have to convert a decimal number into a fraction.[/li]
		[li]Lesson4: factorisation of a given number - in this lesson you have to fractionise given numbers into prime factors. This lesson helps finding the main denominator faster using the prime factor fraction.[/li]
	[/ul]
	Ease of use and the feature to show the score (in percent) make this program a good choice for autonomous schoolwork.</description>
