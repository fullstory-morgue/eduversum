	<description lang="en">Your objective in BlinKen is to reproduce key or sound sequences which get longer with every round. With that it presents a special way of memory-training. On BlinKen's game board, there are 4 differently colored buttons and each one of them has a different sound assigned to it. During the game the buttons light up in a random sequence which the user has to memorize and repeat. If the user manages to repeat the sequence in the right order, he reaches the next game level in which he has to repeat the same sequence plus an added button. When the sequence is repeated in the wrong order, the user loses and he has to start from the beginning. Your target is to obtain as many points as possible. Every successful round gives you one point, a successful sequence of 8 buttons will give you 8 points in the top-scorers list. To use the sound sequences, a ready to work sound-card with speakers or headphones is needed. With the help button (symbolized by a book), the manual can be called.</description>
