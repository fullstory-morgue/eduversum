		The programs in the chemistry section are oriented towards providing information and represent the periodical system.\n\n

		When the chemical processes are written in Java then they can be usually simulated platform independently.\n\n

		Then they can be also used in Linux. Moreover there is a game called "KAtomic", which looks similar to the game Sokoban.\n\n

		In this game atoms are created from molecules.\n\n

		If you are interested in formulas and their representation, please check in the KOffice-package for the application KFormula.\n\n

		In all cases in which we found additional help on the Internet, we have linked it with [i]Info[/i] under the program description (some of it in English).\n\n

		Some links are magazine articles, some are Wiki-Articles. Since we are not the owners of these Articles, we can not guarantee that these links will work when you depend on them to get help.
