		In this "General" section you will find a list of programs  which can be helpful with the teacher's professional duties.\n\n

		There are, besides the very fast KOffice-Package, programs to play videos and multimedia files and also programs like graphic editors or the DeskTop Publishing program Scribus.\n\n

		Also intergrated is a program to visualise thoughts and processes (vym). There are a lot more Applications. \n\n

		For most "teacher's work", these Applications should be enough. We will introduce here the most important ones.\n\n

		If you are looking for help or information for one of the KOffice packages, click on the "Help" menu in the respective program.\n\n

		Reading [a href="http://docs.kde.org/development/en/koffice/"]http://docs.kde.org/development/en/koffice/[/a] can also be helpful - there you can find all the KOffice-Manuals and information that did not make it on to the CD due to limited space.\n\n

		In all cases in where we have found additional help information on the Internet, we have linked it with [i]Info[/i] under the program description. Some of the links are only availble in English.\n\n

		Some of them are magazine articles, some are Wiki-Articles. Since we are not the owners of these Articles, we can not guarantee that these links will work when you depend on them to get help.
