		In the geography section there are programs which support and/or run geographical analysis, the choice of the hour. The first program comes from those.\n\n
		
		In all cases in which we found additional help on the Internet, we have linked it with [i]Info[/i] under the program description (some of it in English).\n\n

		Some links are magazine articles, some are Wiki-Articles. Since we are not the owners of these Articles, we can not guarantee that these links will work when you depend on them to get help.
