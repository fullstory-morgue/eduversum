	<description lang="en">With Krita (also from the KOffice-Project) you can edit pictures and it can also be used as a drawing program with a variety of functions and layers. The fact that it belongs to the KOffice-Project makes using it easier because in the whole KOffice, the same icons are used for the same functions.</description>
