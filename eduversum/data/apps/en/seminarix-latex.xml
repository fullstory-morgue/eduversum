	<description lang="en">LaTeX is a professional text-type system. Its strength is writing scientific text but you can also easily write letters or flashcards to be used for learning.\n\n

	Interesting for teachers is perhaps the ability to create collections with exercises and then combine individual tasks in an exercise sheet. This package installs a complete LaTeX environment with the developing environment Kile and many templates like for example templates for exercise sheets, letters or flashcards.\n\n

	It also installs a quick guide which explains how to install the program, through to creating your first document.\n\n 

	After the installation you can find the templates in the specific menu in Kile and the documents and examples under /usr/share/seminarix-latex/. You can go directly to that directory by clicking seminarix-latex in the "Teaching Aids" menu.
