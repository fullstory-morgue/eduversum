	<description lang="en">KSociograma helps in creating a sociogram for a study group. At the same time various questions, to be chosen/declined from the students, can be given: Who with whom and with this but without that. The evaluation result is statistically and graphically represented. (The 'admin' starts with the password ksocio and can add a sociogramm).</description>
