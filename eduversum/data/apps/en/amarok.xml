	<description lang="en">Amarok is an open-source player for audio files and streams. It is developed for KDE but it also works under other desktop environments like GNOME. It stands out because of its many functions and its capability to store media information into a database. Amarok does not directly play the audio files but it uses various programs and libraries like GStreamer and xine. The support of various audio formats also depends on them.\n\n

	You can in many ways change the looks of Amarok. For example the play window can be shown in the same window as the play-list or in a different window. You can change the colors independently of KDE's colors. The context information are presented using a CSS file.
