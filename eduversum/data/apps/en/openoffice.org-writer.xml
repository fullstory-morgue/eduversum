	<description lang="en">Writer is the word editor of OpenOffice.org: Use it for everything from writing a simple letter to complex books with hyper-links, table of contents, embedded illustrations,  bibliography and whatever else you need. Auto-completion, auto-formating and the spell-checker, make difficult tasks simpler. Writer can also be used for various Desktop-Publishing tasks like the creation of Newsletters with more than one columns or brochures. The only limitation is you fantasy.
