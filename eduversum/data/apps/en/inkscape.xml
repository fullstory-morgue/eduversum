	<description lang="en">Inkscape is an Open-Source vector-graphics editor with abilities that are comparable to those of Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDraw or Xara. It was created as a fork of Sodipodi, based on gtkmm and it is written in C++.\n\n

	Inkscape is for example, suited for the creation of logos, vector-art, technical diagrams, maps, city maps, Flyer-Layouts, CD-covers, posters and comics. Inkscape offers you the possibility to work with other people on the same project via a conference function that uses a Jabber-Server.\n\n
	
	Furthermore Inkscape supports Creative-Commons-Metafiles, node editing, layers, complex path operations, Bitmap-tracing, text belonging to a path, text around an object, direct XML editing and much more. Formats like Postscript, EPS, JPEG, PNG and TIFF can be imported. PNG and various vector-based formats can be exported.
