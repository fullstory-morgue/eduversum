	<description lang="en">Xoscope is a digital oscilloscope, that uses the input from a sound-card's line-in jack. It allows the simultaneous display of 8 signals. Time scales can be divided into intervals ranging from one microsecond to two seconds. It contains external mathematical functions like inverse function, sum, difference , mean value, xy and FFT. 23 buffer storages, 5 automatic measurements and it can load and save files.\n\n
	
	[b]Warning:[/b] You should never connect devices with more than 1,5 volts to your sound-card's line-in jack because this could destroy the sound-card.\n\n
	
	By higher voltages you can reduce the voltage to 1,5V by using a voltage divider so that you do not overcharge your sound-card. Jacks with headphone cables are a suitable measuring cable and can be cheaply bought in many stores. Xoscope is mostly suitable for experiments with time sensitive electrical voltages like for example to measure the generator principal, capacitor's charging and discharging and to measure oscillation processes with electrical signal conversion (for example via a microphone). To measure D.C. voltage it is necessary to convert and calibrate the voltage by using a so-called VCO component (voltage controlled oscillator) because the line-in input is via an upstream capacitor not "passable" by D.C. voltage.</description>
