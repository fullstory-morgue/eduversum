	<description lang="en">This is a small math application that will help pupils to improve their skills in calculating percentages. There is a special training section for the three basic tasks. Finally the pupil can select a random mode, in which all three tasks are mixed randomly. Since the program is a trainer, and not a teacher, users should already know, how to calculate percentages. There will be no hints given to the pupil. This package is part of KDE, as a component of the KDE education module.</description>
