	<description lang="en">SunClock presents a map of the earth and indicates, at a given time, the illuminated portions of the globe. At the presentation you can switch between a time window and a map window. The time window shows a small section (and needs less working memory). The map window shows a big map and offers a list of further functions: local time, sun's possition, position of the moon etc.</description>
