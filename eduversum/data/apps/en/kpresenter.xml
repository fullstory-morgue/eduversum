	<description lang="en">KPresenter is a presentation program contained in KOffice. With the help of KPresenter, slides for an on-screen presentation or for printing, can be prepared. The slides can contain text and graphics in various formats and of course components from other KOffice-programs. An on-screen KPresenter presentation can be exported into HTML and so it can be directly used in websites for example as a slide-show.</description>
